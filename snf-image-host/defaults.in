# snf-image defaults file

# IMAGE_DIR: directory location for disk images

# IMAGE_DEBUG: turn on debugging output for the scripts

# VERSION_CHECK: Check if snf-image and snf-image-helper have the same version.
# This is useful if snf-image is installed as Debian package and not from
# source.
# VERSION_CHECK="@VERSION_CHECK@"

# HELPER_DIR: Directory hosting the helper files
# HELPER_DIR="@localstatedir@/lib/snf-image/helper/"

# HELPER_TIMEOUT: Soft and hard timeout limits for helper instance. The helper
# instance will be terminated after a given time if it hasn't exited by itself.
# A TERM signal will be send if the instance is running after a
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT interval. A KILL signal will be sent, if the instance is
# still running after a HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT interval since the initial signal
# was sent. The timeout values are integer numbers with an optional suffix: `s'
# for seconds (the default), `m' for minutes, `h' for hours or `d' for days.
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT="120"
# HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT="5"

# HELPER_USER: For security reasons, it is recommended that the helper VM
# runs as an unprivileged user. KVM drops root privileges and runs as
# HELPER_USER immediately before starting execution of the helper VM.
# HELPER_USER="nobody"

# HELPER_MEMORY: Virtual RAM size in megabytes to be given to the helper VM.
# HELPER_MEMORY="512"

# HELPER_DEBUG: When enabled, the helper VM will drop to a root shell
# whenever a task fails. This allows the administrator or a developer
# to examine its internal state for debugging purposes.
# To access the shell, use a program like 'minicom' to connect to /dev/pts/X on
# the host, where /dev/pts/X is the name of the device reported in the Ganeti
# OS installation logs for helper's 3rd serial port, e.g.,
# "char device redirected to /dev/pts/9 (label serial3)".
# This feature is KVM-specific for the time being.
# For HELPER_DEBUG to be useful, you also need to set HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT
# to a much higher value.
# WARNING: DO NOT ENABLE THIS FEATURE IN PRODUCTION. Every failure to deploy
# an Image will cause the helper VM to hang.

# MULTISTRAP_CONFIG: Configuration file to be used with multistrap to create
# the rootfs of the helper image.

# files will be injected to the helper image before multistrap is called.

# XEN_SCRIPTS_DIR: Directory where the Xen scripts are stored
# XEN_SCRIPTS_DIR="@sysconfdir@/xen/scripts"

# XEN_CMD: This variable specifies the Xen CLI tool snf-image should use. This
# depends on the XEN version and configuration and should probably coincide
# with the Ganeti's xen_cmd hypervisor parameter for xen-hvm or xen-pvm. Right
# now the supported ones are 'xm' and 'xl'.

# PITHOS_DB: Pithos database in SQLAlchemy format
# PITHOS_DB="sqlite:////@localstatedir@/lib/pithos/backend.db"

# PITHOS_BACKEND_STORAGE: Select Pithos backend storage. Possible values are
# 'nfs' and 'rados'. According to the value you select, you need to set the

# If you select 'nfs' that's 'PITHOS_DATA'. If you select 'rados' then you need
# to set all the "*_RADOS_*" ones.

# PROGRESS_MONITOR: External program that monitors the progress of the image
# deployment. The snf-image monitor messages will be redirected to the standard
# input of this program.
# PROGRESS_MONITOR="@PROGRESS_MONITOR@"

# DHCP_TAGS: Space separated list of Ganeti network tags. snf-image will

# card's NETWORK_TAGS variable.
# STATELESS_DHCPV6_TAGS="nfdhcpd stateless_dhcpv6"

# UNATTEND: This variable overwrites the unattend.xml file used when deploying
# a Windows image. snf-image-helper will use its own unattend.xml file if this
# variable is empty.
# WARNING: This variable is DEPRECATED. If you need to define an answer file
# different that the one shipped with snf-image, which is very likely, put it
# inside the image or use the os_answer_file OS parameter.
# UNATTEND="@UNATTEND@"

# WINDOWS_TIMEZONE: This variable is used to specify the time zone when
# deploying a Windows image. This will only work if you are using snf-image's
# default OS answer file. If the Windows image already contains an answer file,
# which should by itself specify a time zone in order to have an unattended
# Windows customization process, this variable will be completely ignored. For
# a list of available time zones, check here:
